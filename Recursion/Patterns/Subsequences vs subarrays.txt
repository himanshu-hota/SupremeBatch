// SUBARRAYS AND SUBSEQUENCES

Are subsequences and subarrays same?

Subarray: A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of an array. In other words, a subarray is formed by selecting consecutive elements from the original array. For example, if you have an array [1, 2, 3], the subarrays would be [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3].

Subsequence: A subsequence, on the other hand, doesn't have to be contiguous. It is a sequence of elements that appears in the same order as in the original array but not necessarily consecutively. Using the same example, the subsequences would be [], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3].

In summary, every subarray is a subsequence, but not every subsequence is a subarray. Subsequences can have gaps between elements, while subarrays are always contiguous.

// 

Subarray: 

A subarray is a contiguous (consecutive) subsequence within an array.
All the elements in a subarray are in the same order as they appear in the original array.
Example: Consider the array [1, 2, 3, 4]. Subarrays include [1, 2], [2, 3, 4], and [3], but not [1, 3] or [1, 4].

ex. Subarray of [1,2,3]
[1]
[1, 2]
[1, 2, 3]
[2]
[2, 3]
[3]


Subsequence :

A subsequence is a sequence of elements that appears in the same order as in the original sequence, but not necessarily consecutively.
Elements in a subsequence are not required to be adjacent in the original sequence.
Example: For the sequence [1, 2, 3], subsequences include [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], and [1, 2, 3]. Note that [1, 3, 2] is not a subsequence.

ex. subsequence of [1,2,3] :

[]
[1]
[2]
[3]
[1, 2]
[1, 3]
[2, 3]
[1, 2, 3]


Subset :

A subset is a set of elements that are chosen from a larger set, and the order of elements does not matter.
Every array is a subset of itself, and the empty set is also considered a subset of any set.
Example: For the set {1, 2, 3}, subsets include {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}, and the empty set {}. Note that the order of elements doesn't matter in subsets.

ex. Subsets of [1,2,3]

{}
{1}
{2}
{3}
{1, 2}
{1, 3}
{2, 3}
{1, 2, 3}


In summary:

A subarray is a contiguous portion of an array.
A subsequence is a sequence of elements that maintains their relative order, but not necessarily consecutively.
A subset is a set of elements, and the order doesn't matter.
Remember that the terms "subarray" and "subsequence" are often used in the context of arrays or sequences, while "subset" is a more general term used in set theory.

// So can we say subsets and subsequences are same

No, subsets and subsequences are not the same, although they share some similarities.

Subsets:

A subset is a set of elements that are chosen from a larger set.
The order of elements does not matter.
Every array is a subset of itself.
The empty set is also considered a subset of any set.
Example: For the array {1, 2, 3}, subsets include {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}.

Subsequences:

A subsequence is a sequence of elements that appears in the same order as in the original sequence, but not necessarily consecutively.
The order of elements matters.
Example: For the array {1, 2, 3}, subsequences include [], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3].


In summary, while every subset is a subsequence, not every subsequence is a subset. Subsequences must maintain the order of elements, whereas subsets do not consider the order. The distinction becomes clearer when dealing with sequences or arrays where the order of elements matters.

One liner : Note: A subarray is a subsequence, a subsequence is a subset but the reverse order is not correct.
