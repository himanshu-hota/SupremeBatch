        while(start <= end){
            int mid = start + (end - start)/2;

            // check how many hours would it take to finish totalBanans with mid speed.
            int totalHours = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i< piles.length; i++){
                totalHours += Math.ceil((double)piles[i] / (double)mid);
            }

            // if we got totalHours less then required hours then it is a possible soluion.
            // try to minimize the hour.
            if(totalHours <= h){
                end = mid-1;
            }else{
                start = mid+1;
            }
        }

        return start;
    }
}

Steps : 1. Get the total count of bananas and pile that has max bananas(which will be the max speed).
        2. Perform binary search from 1 -> totalBananas as the speed must be between this range.
        3. From 1 -> totalBananas, try the mid as speed and check if koko can eat all bananas with mid speed, if yes then try to minimize the speed(as ques. said).
